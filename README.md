<!-- DARK THEME CYBERSECURITY PROFILE -->

# 👋 Hi, I'm Felix Halim

I’m someone who truly enjoys understanding how technology works — especially how to keep systems, data, and people safe. My background is a mix of **cybersecurity**, **software skills**, and **business leadership**, and I’m currently strengthening everything through my **MBA in IT Management (finishing August 2026).**

I like solving problems, breaking things down logically, and creating practical solutions that make technology safer and easier to use.
